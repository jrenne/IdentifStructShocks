The identification and estimation of dynamic responses to structural shocks is one of the principal goals of macroeconometrics. These responses correspond to the effect, over time, of an exogenous intervention that propagates through the economy, as modelled by a system of simultaneous equations.

Over the last decades, several methodologies have been proposed so as to estimate these responses. The objective of this course, developed by [Kenza Benhima](https://sites.google.com/site/benhimakenza/) and [Jean-Paul Renne](https://sites.google.com/site/jeanpaulrenne/home), is to provide an exhaustive view of these methodologies and to provide students with tools enabling them to implement them in various contexts.

Codes associated with this course are part of the `AEC` package, which is available on GitHub. To install it, one need to employ the `devtools` library:

```{r installAEC, eval=FALSE}
library(devtools)
install_github("jrenne/AEC")
library(AEC)
```

<!-- <!-- To specify the corresponding covariance matrix vcov. to be used, there are three possibilities: 1. It is pre-computed and supplied in argument vcov.. 2. A function for extracting the covariance matrix from x is supplied, e.g., sandwich, vcovHC, vcovCL, or vcovHAC from package sandwich.  -->
